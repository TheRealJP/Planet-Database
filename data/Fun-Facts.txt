Mercury has extreme temperature swings — it can be 430°C (800°F) during the day and −180°C (−290°F) at night.
Venus spins backward compared to most planets, so the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east there.
A day on Venus is longer than its year — it takes longer to rotate once than to orbit the Sun.
Earth is the only known planet with liquid water on its surface and life.
Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, nearly three times taller than Mount Everest.
Jupiter is so massive that it could fit more than 1,300 Earths inside it.
Saturn’s rings are made mostly of ice and rock and are incredibly thin compared to how wide they are.
Uranus is tilted on its side at about 98°, causing extreme seasons that last over 20 years each.
Neptune has the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds over 2,000 km/h (1,200 mph).
Pluto (a dwarf planet) has a heart-shaped glacier, discovered by NASA’s New Horizons mission
