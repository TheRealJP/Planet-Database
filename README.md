this project is for about Git Workflows

Planets in our solar system orbit the Sun and come in many different sizes, compositions, and environments. The four inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are rocky worlds with solid surfaces, while the four outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are much larger and made mostly of gas or ice. Each planet has unique features, such as Saturn’s rings, Jupiter’s massive storms, and Earth’s ability to support life. Together with dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets, the planets form a complex and fascinating system that shows how diverse worlds can be within a single solar family.
